## why use oop

## parts of oop
object literal 
-constructor function :-> it iS  a special method whithin class is auto atically invojed when new object of that class is created.
- prototypes
-classes
-instnace(new,this)

## 4 pillars
abstractions - means show the essential details . and hide the complextiy.. an ex.. we can drive the car ..we have to use break gare pedal ..but we dont knoe how to engine work.

encapsulation - menas hiding the interal state of object .. ex.. we all r using the atm machine .. insert the card .. eithdraw the cash ..but we dont  see how to machine work.

inhertiance - it allow a class to inherit the properties and method from another class.
polymorphism - same meyhod but  behave differnetly based on object
